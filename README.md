# Owls-12
**B2L Project Tier1**

This repository was created for the build to learn project in Chingu Voyage. The project we're going to reproduce is [paperbot](https://paperbot.ai/).

Paperbot is an app that collects and organizes your most valuable contents shared on Slack. We're in owls team, and hence we're limiting ourselves to front-end functionalities of the app. Demo can be viewed [here](https://chingu-coders.github.io/owl-12).

# Contribution Guidelines
What is needed for now is just the raw HTML5 structure of the document..
Contributors should modify **only** the index.html file and write the whole document.
No need to modify anything outside &lt;body&gt; tag.

After this, then we'll start working on our stylesheet.
